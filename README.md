# BLACKJACK
Hey this is my first Python Project!
# RULES OF BLACKJACK - 
->The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.  
->Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.  
->Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.  
->To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.  
->If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.  
->If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.   
->Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.
