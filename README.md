# BLACKJACK
Hey this is my first Python Project!
# RULES OF BLACKJACK - 
->The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.  
->Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.  
->Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.  
->To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.  
->If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.  
->If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.  
->Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet. Depends on the casino.  
->Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.  
->Doubling is like a hit, only the bet is doubled and you only get one more card.  
->Split can be done when you have two of the same card - the pair is split into two hands.  
->Splitting also doubles the bet, because each new hand is worth the original bet.  
->You can only double/split on the first move, or first move of a hand created by a split.  
->You cannot play on two aces after they are split.  
->You can double on a hand resulting from a split, tripling or quadrupling you bet.
